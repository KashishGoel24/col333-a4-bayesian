1. Intiailize not using uniform values but read the input file once to intialize smartly (ignore question marks and then count)
2. Improve the data structure 
3. Our iterations are too slow ? why ? 
4. What if there are no question marks ? 
5. Also the places where the data point is low in number , just read that more times ? not everything else ,in which we are already very confident about the values ?
6. Read code from github 2 years ago ? 
7. Explore new ideas, read about how to train a bayesian network
